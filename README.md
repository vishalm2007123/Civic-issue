# 🚀 SpotFix — Smart Civic Issue Reporting Platform





## 📌 Problem Statement

Civic issues such as potholes, garbage overflow, streetlight failures, and drainage problems often remain unresolved due to slow reporting systems and lack of transparency between citizens and authorities.




## 💡 Solution — SpotFix

**SpotFix** is a smart civic engagement platform that allows citizens to report issues easily, track their resolution status transparently, and visualize complaint hotspots using an **interactive heatmap**.

The platform bridges the gap between **citizens and government authorities** through dedicated dashboards, analytics, and a reward-based engagement system.
